## TFSA Rules

1. **Eligibility**:
   - Must be 18 years or older
   - Must have a valid Social Insurance Number (SIN)
   - Contribution room starts accumulating from the year you turn 18

2. **Contribution Room**:
   - Contribution room accumulates every year whether you open a TFSA or not
   - Unused contribution room carries forward indefinitely
   - Withdrawals from a TFSA are added back to your contribution room, but not until the beginning of the following year

3. **Tax Treatment**:
   - Contributions are not tax-deductible (unlike RRSPs)
   - Investment growth is completely tax-free
   - Withdrawals are completely tax-free and do not affect eligibility for federal income-tested benefits and credits

4. **Over-Contribution Penalty**:
   - 1% per month tax on the highest excess amount in each month
   - Applies if you contribute more than your available TFSA contribution room

5. **Withdrawal Rules**:
   - Withdrawals can be made at any time for any reason
   - No tax consequences for withdrawals
   - Withdrawn amounts are added back to contribution room, but not until January 1 of the year following the withdrawal

6. **Investment Options**:
   - Similar to RRSPs: cash, GICs, mutual funds, publicly traded securities, bonds
   - Cannot hold investments for business purposes

7. **No Age Limit for Contributions**:
   - Unlike RRSPs, there is no requirement to convert a TFSA to an income fund at age 71
   - You can continue to contribute to a TFSA throughout your lifetime as long as you have contribution room

This information is crucial for the retirement planner application as it defines the maximum annual contributions to TFSAs and the tax implications of these accounts.
