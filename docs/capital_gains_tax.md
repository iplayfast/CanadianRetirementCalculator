# Canadian Capital Gains Tax Research

## Capital Gains Inclusion Rate

In Canada, capital gains are subject to a 50% inclusion rate for 2025. This means:

- Only 50% of capital gains are taxable
- The taxable portion is added to your income and taxed at your marginal tax rate
- This applies to all capital gains under $250,000

## Important Notes for Retirement Planning

1. When withdrawing from non-registered investment accounts in retirement, only 50% of any capital gains realized will be taxable.

2. Capital gains are only realized when assets are sold. Unrealized capital gains (increases in value of assets still held) are not taxed.

3. Capital gains from the sale of a principal residence are generally tax-exempt in Canada.

4. For retirement planning purposes, the 50% inclusion rate is a significant advantage compared to other forms of investment income:
   - Interest income is 100% taxable
   - Dividend income from Canadian corporations receives a dividend tax credit
   - Capital gains are only 50% taxable

5. Tax planning strategies for retirees often involve managing the timing of capital gains realization to minimize overall tax burden.

## Recent Developments

The Canadian government had proposed increasing the capital gains inclusion rate to 66.67% for gains exceeding $250,000, but this change has been deferred until at least January 1, 2026. For the 2025 tax year, the inclusion rate remains at 50%.

This information is crucial for the retirement planner application as it affects how investment withdrawals will be taxed in retirement.
